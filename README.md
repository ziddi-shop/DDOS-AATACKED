**Tool: DDoS Attack  😈⚡️**

The tool attacks websites randomly and violently 🔥

**Quick Explanation 〰:**  
All you need to do is:  
1. Open the tool and choose one of the 4 options — just explore them.  
2. The most important option is the first one. Choose it and input the website's IP address 🌏.  
   - If you don’t know how to get the IP, select option 4, input the website link, and it will fetch the IP for you. It will also suggest the best ports for the attack 💸.  
3. After entering the IP, specify the port ✨.  
4. Enter the number of threads ✨.  
5. Start the attack ✔️.  

The tool might not work perfectly with all websites, but you can easily improve it as it’s not encrypted 🤍.  

**No issues 💯**  
- Consumes internet bandwidth in seconds 🗿  
- No encryption 💬  

*(I created it to quickly complete something because I’m working on a time-consuming project and don’t have time 🗿⛔️.)*
